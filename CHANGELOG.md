0.1.1 Added error tracking

Included Bugsnag, which will hopefully keep me informed of any errors, and also updated Google Analytics tracking code

0.1.0 Beta release

The initial version of the application. Allows people to select images from their device, add a note and then select which Pinterest board they should be sent to.

Users can select individual boards for each image, or select a board for all images to be sent to.

Currently the application uses a pretty raw implementation of FileReader to load up images, which is not the best for
performance, but that will be updated in the near future
